summary: This post was inspired by Khoi Vo, who recommended a way of tracking the different cognitive control terms that he encountered since he thought it could be confusing to remember them all (indeed it is!) This post will be added to over time.

#### Between-tasks interference/ (backward) crosstalk
It's easier to complete `task A` (the prioritized task) on its own than if you're multi-tasking and doing `task B` (the secondary task); it takes cognitive control to block out `task B` and focus on/prioritize `task A`; interference/crosstalk increases as 1) similarity, 2) temporal overlap between `task A` and `task B` increase
