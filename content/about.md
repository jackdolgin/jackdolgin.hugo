I studied cognitive neuroscience at Duke University, graduating with distinction in 2018 and serving first as an undergraduate RA in a clinical lab under [Dr. M. Zachary Rosenthal](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/mark-zachary-rosenthal) and subsequently a neuroeconomics lab under [Dr. Scott Huettel](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/scott-huettel), and then subsequently as a lab manager since graduation, studying cognitive control under [Dr. Tobias Egner](https://psychandneuro.duke.edu/people/tobias-egner).

After my two-year stint as lab manager ends this summer, I will be starting my Ph.D. with [Dr. Wouter Kool](https://psych.wustl.edu/people/wouter-kool) at Washington University in St. Louis, funded in part by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I’m particularly excited about working with Dr. Kool because I’ll be studying the sweet-spot of my decision-making lab experience and cognitive control—with Dr. Kool I’ll investigate the decision-making behind cognitive control, or when and why people engage in effortful thinking.

I really like to code and especially in [Python](https://github.com/search?q=language%3APython+user%3Ajackdolgin&s=indexed&type=Code) and [R](https://github.com/search?q=language%3AR+user%3Ajackdolgin&s=indexed&type=Code). You can view a few of my projects [here](https://jackdolgin.shinyapps.io/rhythmic_attention/), [here](https://github.com/jackdolgin/Bejjani_Dolgin_Zhang_Egner_2019), and [here](https://jackdolgin.shinyapps.io/GreekLifeDemographics/). I've implemented novel temporal pattern analyses in eye-tracking with R, and generally I have experience with eye-tracking and, more recently, fMRI.
